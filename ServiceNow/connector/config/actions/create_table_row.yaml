                  Hi David, \nThat must be it. I was on phone calls at all three of\
                  \ those times and must not have had any activity on my computer.\
                  \ Please close this incident.\n\n2016-12-13 10:42:25 - David Loo\
                  \ (Additional comments)\nHi Joe,\nI've checked in network logs and\
                  \ you were timed out from the VPN at 9:25AM, 10:42AM and 2:28PM.\
                  \ These three times coincide with entries in the exchange server\
                  \ logs showing you lost connection at those same times. The VPN\
                  \ policy is to time out a connection if it hasn't been active in\
                  \ 30 minutes. Please ensure the next time you lose connectivity\
                  \ you are still\_connected to the VPN.\n\nI'm going to update this\
                  \ incident to resolved. Please let me know if you need any more\
                  \ assistance.\n\n2016-12-13 07:53:01 - Joe Employee (Additional\
                  \ comments)\nHi David,\nThank you! I use the corporate VPN and was\
                  \ also unable to connect to the email server at 9:30AM and 10:45AM.\n\

                  My name is David.\_I'll be assisting you with this incident. Can\
                  \ you confirm which VPN you have been using today?\_I also see you\
                  \ were having this issue at 2:30PM. Were there any other times you\
                  \ can recall you had issues connecting to the email?\n\n2016-12-12\

                  \ discussion on call, Workaround has been provided and it has worked\
                  \ for you. I have verified with the Exchange team we haven't had\
                  \ an issue with the email server today. I'm going to assign this\
                  \ issue to the network team for further investigation.\n\n2016-12-12\

            Hi Joe,\nI've checked in network logs and you were timed out from the\
            \ VPN at 9:25AM, 10:42AM and 2:28PM. These three times coincide with entries\
            \ in the exchange server logs showing you lost connection at those same\
            \ times. The VPN policy is to time out a connection if it hasn't been\
            \ active in 30 minutes. Please ensure the next time you lose connectivity\
            \ you are still\_connected to the VPN.\n\nI'm going to update this incident\

              Hi Joe,\nI've checked in network logs and you were timed out from the\
              \ VPN at 9:25AM, 10:42AM and 2:28PM. These three times coincide with\
              \ entries in the exchange server logs showing you lost connection at\
              \ those same times. The VPN policy is to time out a connection if it\
              \ hasn't been active in 30 minutes. Please ensure the next time you\
              \ lose connectivity you are still\_connected to the VPN.\n\nI'm going\

                \ coincide with entries in the exchange server logs showing you lost\

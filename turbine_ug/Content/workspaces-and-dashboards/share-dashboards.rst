Share Dashboards
================

A dashboard report can be shared by scheduling an email to be sent,
sending an email now, or downloading a PDF of the dashboard report. To
find these sharing options, while in the dashboard, click the ellipsis
on the dashboard header and select **Schedule**, **Email**, or
**Download** under Sharing Options.

   weekly, or monthly at a specified time. For **One Time**, select the
   day and time you would like the schedule to send.

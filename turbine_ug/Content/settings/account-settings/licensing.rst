Licensing
=========

Refer to Licensing to review your Swimlane Turbine license details.
These details include:

-  License type

-  Expiration date

-  Licensed users and applications

   **Note:** Once you reach the limits of licensed users or
   applications, you will no longer be able to add new users or
   applications, but existing users and applications will continue to
   function. Be aware that disabled users do not count toward your
   license, so disabling users in order to add additional active users
   can occur.

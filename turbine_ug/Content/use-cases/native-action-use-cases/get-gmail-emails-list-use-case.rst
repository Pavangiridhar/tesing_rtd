.. _scenario-get-gmail-email-ids-use-case:

Scenario
--------

Alex is an analyst who needs to set up her Gmail account, so that her
playbook can retrieve a list of emails to pass along data outside of the
playbook. Alex already logged into Turbine to access the Swimlane
Content.

#. From the Swimlane Content, search for and install the **Google
   Workspace** connector.

#. Navigating to the Orchestration menu, Alex selects **Assets** and
   click the plus icon.

The Select An Asset Type windows provides a list of assets.

#. Search for the **Google Authentication** asset.

Alex gives the asset a title and needs to add the required properties to
achieve her task.

#. Click **Add a property**.

#. Add the **GMail - List Emails** connector.

#. Click **Configure**.

#. From the Available assets drop-down menu, select
   **Google_Workspace**.

Conclusion
----------

Alex successfully created a playbook with list of Gmail emails with
promoted outputs to use in another playbook, and now that she is
familiar with setting up the Google Workspace connector, she can
replicate these steps in another playbook to enhance with a similar
connector.

Events
======

Events are contextual details of information received by a sensor. An
event can be used to trigger playbooks.

As an orchestrator, you can view data about specific events under the
ORCHESTRATION section.

This page shows:

-  Event activity for the last 24 hours

-  The table shows event types, the agent or host, time the event was
   received, and the number of triggered playbooks. For additional
   details about event data, click the expand arrow to the left of the
   **Event Type** column.

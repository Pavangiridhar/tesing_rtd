Log in to Turbine
=================

When you are initially set up as a user in Swimlane Turbine, you are
sent an invitation email. The email includes a link to log in. Click the
link, and you'll be taken to the Turbine login screen, where you can log
in with your email address. The first time you access Turbine, you will
be prompted to create a new password.

**Note:** New user invitation emails expire after 72 hours.

If you are prompted to recreate a password, do so immediately.

You will be locked out of Turbine after 5 incorrect login attempts,
after which you will have to reset your password.

If you know that your organization is using SSO, click **Login via
SSO**.

As of the Turbine Cloud 2023 Release 2, Swimlane is restricting the
capability of logging in with usernames. You will only be allowed to log
in with your unique email address.

**Important!** If you have multiple tenants set up, and discover two
email addresses that are the same, the administrator will be forced to
make one email address unique in order for the log in to work.

That said, know that you can identify unique usernames. When you
customize your user profile, you can assign yourself a unique username.
Each username is valid within a Turbine Cloud tenant.

**Note:** Usernames are used as User IDs in LDAP sync and SSO, and will
continue to be used for these processes.

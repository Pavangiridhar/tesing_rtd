Applets and Workflow
====================

| You can create an applet that contains workflow. When you add an
  applet to an application, Swimlane Turbine notifies you that the
  applet workflow is being added to the application and new application
  tasks will be created for each of the applet tasks. The workflow is
  also added.

| As you build out workflow within an applet, the branches don't have to
  be fully configured. Conditions and actions in applet workflow are
  highlighted with a question mark and a yellow outline.

| Saved applets can then be added to applications. Save the application
  with the new applet, and then access the application's workflow to
  enable the conditions and actions.

| When you access the workflow editor, you can see that the workflow is
  there, but by default it is added in a disabled state. You will need
  to manually activate the workflow conditions and actions.

| Workflow behavior has been updated to alert you to enable workflow
  conditions and actions. When you first access the Workflow editor
  after adding an applet with workflow, the editor highlights the
  section of new workflow in a glowing, pulsing yellow. After that,
  you'll see the workflow conditions and actions are grayed out. Click
  the workflow stages and actions to enable them and (as needed) to
  continue to configure them.

Orchestration
=============

Orchestration integrates security tools and platforms to improve your
organization’s security intelligence and enhance context to enable
better and faster decision making. Turbine Canvas is a part of Swimlane
Orchestration, which combines machine learning, customer experience, and
artificial intelligence to serve as the system of record.

   assets, components, inputs/outputs, interfaces

   before Canvas, where you can maintain, update, and create existing

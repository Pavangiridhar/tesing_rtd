Workspaces
==========

Workspaces are customizable areas within the Turbine Platform where you
can organize and access the Turbine tools and features that you use on a
regular basis. Workspaces can include Applications, Dashboards, Records,
Reports, and Charts.

Administrators can change the default workspace and dashboards for
users, and users can switch to different Workspaces and Dashboards
according to the permissions assigned to them.

To select the workspace that you want to view or work in, click
**WORKSPACES**. A list of the available Workspaces are listed. Select
the Workspace you need.

You can only load and view a single Workspace at a time.

You can create, edit, and delete workspaces from the Workspaces list
page.

To create a new workspace, click **+New Workspace**. Define the general
information about the workspace and set permissions as needed.

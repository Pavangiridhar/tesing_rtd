Configure Numeric Array Condition Expressions
=============================================

Turbine allows users to configure conditions between two actions by
utilizing playbook inputs and/or action outputs.

Scenario
--------

Alex wants to configure a numeric array in a conditional expression
using the output of a JSONata action. Alex is ready to begin. She starts
by adding and configuring a JSONata connector with an **On Success**
action flow, and now she wants to add a numeric array conditional
expression.

#. To add a condition, click the **Add condition** icon.

   **Note:** Once you click the action flow, it turns blue and the FLOW
   panel displays to the right.

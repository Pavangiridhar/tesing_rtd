Tenant Management in Turbine Cloud
==================================

Utilizing tenants in Turbine cloud allows you to scale and innovate.

You can have up to three tenants. All tenants are currently in one
region. When you first setup with Swimlane, your Swimlane support
representative will set up one administrator who has access to tenant
provisioning and a user/group definition. Then, within each tenant you
can set up local administrators, orchestrators, and other customized
roles. To request additional tenants, reach out to your Swimlane support
representative.

Each Turbine instance has its own account administrator. This account
administrator can:

-  Set up users, groups, and roles, including additional administrators.
   The administrator can also create orchestrator-type roles.
-  Assign and restrict create, read, update, and delete permissions.

As an administrator, you have access to the Cloud Admin panel. To access
the panel, click your profile (in the upper-right corner of the Turbine
platform) and then select *Go to accounts*.

You can set up additional users and roles from the Admin panel. When
assigning roles, you also have the capability of setting up access to
all Turbine elements, which includes Create, Read, Update, and Delete
access to all of Turbine's orchestration features. If you are creating
numerous roles of the same type, click the **Duplicate role** button.

You can also assign specific access to workspaces, dashboards,
applications, applets, and records. This means you can separate your
administrators from your automation workforce and analysts.

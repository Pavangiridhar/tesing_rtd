Disaster Recovery

``not available yet - next iteration``

This topic contains an outline of how Swimlane supports you in case of
data disaster and recovery.

Swimlane stores snapshots in multiple geographic regions. In the event
of a disaster, the infrastructure will be rebuilt in a working region
and the most recent snapshot will be restored.

All Swimlane information assets are assigned a sensitivity level based
on the appropriate audience for the information. If the information has
been previously classified by regulatory, legal, contractual, or company
directive, then that classification takes precedence.

Swimlane Recovery Time Objective (RTO) SLA is 24 hours.

Swimlane meets many if not all HIPAA requirements and prohibits the
collection of PII for purposes other than those communicated to the data
subject or relevant entity.

Swimlane is currently undergoing audits for both SOC2 Type 1 and Type 2,
ISO27001.

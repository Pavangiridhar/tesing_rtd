Welcome to Swimlane Turbine Documentation
=========================================

Swimlane Turbine is a low-code security automation platform that
transcends traditional SOAR by capturing hard-to-reach telemetry and
expanding actionability beyond the typically closed extended detection
and response (XDR) ecosystem.

Want to be an automator? No problem! 

Turbine makes automation approachable, simpler to deploy and manageable,
and integrates with any API. You or someone from your security team can
quickly automate repetitive, mundane tasks, stop threats faster, and
reduce security risk by using Turbine. So let's get started!
